# Micro Wasteland

## I. High Concept
Play as a microscopic cell, fending for himself in a harsh microbiome where everyone is the enemy. Fight viruses and bacteria, leveling up your stats as you go. How long can you survive?

## II. Genre
Roguelike, action, shooter.

## III. Platform
Desktop only.

## IV. Story
You are a lone cell who must fight and evolve to survive against aggressive bacteria and viruses.

## V. Aesthetics
Abstract, minimal, flat graphics style. Ambient looped background music. There will be simple sounds for when the user presses any button in the ui, and an attack sound for both the player and all enemies.

## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player is placed into a procedurally generated, 2d, top down world. Enemies will spawn randomly and become stronger as the game progresses. The player and enemies can either shoot a projectile or directly collide with the opponent to deal damage. The player will have stats that upon killing enemies can be leveled up such as HP, speed, attack, and projectile speed. Upon dying, the high score for enemies killed will be displayed and saved.
### Control
Use the mouse to navigate the ui. Use the arrow keys to move. Use the spacebar to shoot. Hit esc to access the upgrade/pause menu.
### Onboarding
The game should be mostly intuitive. Instructions will include an image showing the controls at the beginning of each playthrough. Also, the first time the player has leveled up, an image will appear showing how to access the upgrade/pause menu.
### Player learning
The game is based on a model of improving a high score, so the player will naturally become mechanically better as they play more and die more. In addition, the stat upgrade system will allow players to experiment with different paths, and see what strategy works best.
